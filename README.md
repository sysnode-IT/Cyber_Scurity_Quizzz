## 🎯 About the Project

**CyberQuiz** is a browser-based quiz game designed to test and strengthen cybersecurity awareness. It covers 6 major domains of cybersecurity with 180 unique questions spanning three difficulty levels. The game features a countdown timer, live scoring, grade evaluation, and a post-quiz answer review system — all in a single HTML file with a cyberpunk-inspired UI.

This project was built to demonstrate front-end development skills, knowledge of cybersecurity concepts, and the ability to design an engaging educational tool.
